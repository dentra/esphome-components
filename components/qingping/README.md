# Qingping BLE platform

This platform implements parsing Qingping BLE advertisements and exposing them as sensors or binary sensors.

Supported known data points:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Battery
- Door/Window/Opening
- Door/Window/Opening problem
- Pressure
- Motion
- Illuminance
- Light
- PM 2.5
- PM 10
- Carbon Dioxide (CO2)

Also supports any other type via automation or feature request.

Provide explorier feature to get data without knowing MAC-address or supported data points.

Minimal sample configuration:

```yaml
# Load component implementation and code generation helpers from github.
external_components:
  - source: github://dentra/esphome-components
    components: [qingping, codegen]

# Define qingping BLE listener on specified MAC-address.
qinping:
  mac_address: 11:22:33:44:55:66

sensor:
  - platform: qingping
    type: co2
    name: CO2

binary_sensor:
  - platform: qingping
    type: light
    name: Light
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not receiving Qingping BLE advertisements on WiFi device you may need to connect it to the cloud.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To compile properly this component requires C++17 with GNU extensions and up.
> It automatically changes environment to `gnu++17` to support it.

## Configuring Qingping Hub.

The Qingping platform is using [esp32_ble_tracker] so you able to configure it first.

The Qingping platform maintains a list of hubs, each of which is responsible for
listening to a specific device. The exception is a hub with explorer or with verbose mode,
it can listen any device.

```yaml
# Load component implementation and code generation helpers from github.
external_components:
  - source: github://dentra/esphome-components
    components: [qingping, codegen]

qingping:
  - id: qp_th
    # MAC-address is required for specific defice.
    mac_address: 11:22:33:44:55:66
  - id: qp_air_monitor
    # MAC-address is required for specific defice.
    mac_address: 11:22:33:44:55:77
    # Log all processed packets
    verbose: true
  - id: qp_new_device
    # MAC-address is required for specific defice.
    mac_address: 11:22:33:44:55:88
    # Log all processed packets
    verbose: true
    on_state:
      - lambda: |-
          // cast to known structure that work with battery level data type
          auto *battery = x.cast<QPDataBatteryLevel>();
          // check that our variable fits this data point
          if (battery) {
            ESP_LOGD("main", "Battery Level %f (%u)",
              battery->get_battery_level(), battery->raw_battery_level);
          }
      - lambda: |-
          // check for known data point QPID::BATTERY
          if (x.type == QPID::BATTERY) {
              // cast to known structure that work with battery level data type
              auto *battery = x.cast<QPDataBatteryLevel>();
              ESP_LOGD("main", "Battery Level %f (%u)",
                battery->get_battery_level(), battery->raw_battery_level);
          }
      - lambda: |-
          // check for unknown 0x55 data point
          if (x.raw_type == 0x55) {
            // cast to universal structure that work with any data type
            auto *type55 = x.cast<QPDataRaw>();
            ESP_LOGD("main", "Type 55 value is %u", type55->u16);
          }

  - id: qp_explorer
    # listen all mac-addresses and automatically create sensors/binary_sensor for known data points
    explorer:
      # do not create and publish temperature sensor
      temperature: False
      # do not create and publish motion binary_sensor
      motion: False
      # create battery level sensor with name "Battery"
      battery_level: Battery
    # Log all processed packets
    verbose: true

sensor:
  - platform: qingping
    # attach sensor to qp_th hub
    qingping_id: qp_th
    type: battery
    name: Battery Level

  - platform: qingping
    # attach sensor to qp_air_monitor hub
    qingping_id: qp_air_monitor
    type: carbon_dioxide
    name: Carbon Dioxide
```

    name: Light
```

### Configuration variables:
