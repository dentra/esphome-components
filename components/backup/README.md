# Backup

Save your ESPHome device configuration in firmware and and recover it if you lost source files. Just download it from `http://yourdevice.local/config.yaml`.

> WARNING: You should backup your all your files, this solution only for emergency purpose. I am not responsible for the loss or inability to recover data.

> WARNING: Stored configuration is the same as shown by `esphome config` command. It is fully worked but not the same as your original sources.

> WARNING: Command line substitutions, custom components and includes are not supported yet!

The configuration is very simple. Look at a sample below:

```yaml
# Full example of configuration entry
 ...
external_components:
  - source: github://dentra/esphome-components
 ...
backup:
  auth:
    username: !secret web_username
    password: !secret web_password
  force_update: false
```

## Configuration variables:

- **auth** (_Optional_): Enables basic authentication with username and password.
- **username** (**Required**, string): The username to use for authentication.
- **password** (**Required**, string): The password to check for authentication.
- **force_update** (_Optional_, boolean): Unnecessary but might be needed when you changes in separated files are not detected properly. Default is False.
